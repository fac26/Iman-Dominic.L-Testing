1) Creating an empty array to add to do's to (Test- is there an array present)
2) Creating an input box under to allow for user input

4) Update the DOM with the new array (should do automatically)
5) Done button - when clicked on, should alert the user that the task is complete - e.g. crossing over or change colour. (Test: When clicking on the button, does the CSS colour of the word/entry change to green? If yes, pass.)
6) Delete button - when clicked on, does it remove the entry from the array.
7) Delete button should only appear after entry is made into the array.
