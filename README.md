# Project description:

Our project is designed to help people manage their commitments and work their way through projects efficiently. It was created as part of the Founders and Coders Skills Bootcamp, to improve our knowledge in testing such as unit testing and test-driven development (TDD).

# User story:

Before starting our project, we designed a plan on what the app would look like. This is shown below:

1) Creating an empty array to add to do's to (Test- is there an array present)
2) Creating an input box under to allow for user input 
3) Creating a submit button next to the user input. This submit button will add the user input to the array. (Test: if submit button clicked on, set to true, Test: clicking the button adds the item to the array)
4) Update the DOM with the new array (should do automatically)
5) Done button - when clicked on, should alert the user that the task is complete - e.g. crossing over or change colour. (Test: When clicking on the button, does the CSS colour of the word/entry change to green? If yes, pass.)
6) Delete button - when clicked on, does it remove the entry from the array.
7) Delete button should only appear after entry is made into the array.
8) Test (delete button shouldn't delete the wrong row, same for the done button.)

# Accessibility:
Buttons can be activated when switching to them using tab and pressing enter.
